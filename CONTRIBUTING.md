# ðŸ§© Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for contributing!  
Before you open a pull request, please note:

1. **Branch Naming**
   - Use one of these prefixes:
     - `feature/` â€“ new functionality
     - `bugfix/` â€“ defect fix
     - `hotfix/` â€“ urgent production fix
     - `release/` â€“ release preparation
   - Include your artifact ID (e.g., `ART-123`) in the branch name.

2. **Pull Requests**
   - Use the **matching PR template** from the dropdown (`feature`, `bugfix`, etc.).
   - The system will **automatically add the artifact ID and labels** after you create the PR.
   - Please do **not** fill out the artifact or label sections manually.

3. **Code Checks**
   - All PRs trigger CI checks automatically.
   - Wait until all checks pass before requesting review.

4. **Approvals**
   - Feature PRs require **2 reviewer approvals**.
   - Release and hotfix merges are automated after checks pass.

Happy contributing ðŸš€
